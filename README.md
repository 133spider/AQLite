## Information

AQLite is a client made for AQWorlds that provides all sorts of Quality of Life tools that have been longed for. With the approach of the new versions of AQWorlds (AQW2 and AQW:Mobile), I am releasing AQLite to help players wait for the forever-waited changes to the game. AQLite is open-sourced to assure that there is no account-stealing, or any funny business contained in the client!

## Features
* Disable Skill Animations
* Show Your Skill Animations Only (must have disable skill animations enabled)
* Class Skill Passives/Auras UI (BETA) (draggable UI)
* Custom Drops UI
* Draggable Drops
* Hide Players
* Show Monster Type
* Show Quest Drop Rates

## Installation
* Go to "Releases" (or goto this link https://github.com/133spider/AQLite/releases)
* Choose and Download the .zip file according to your operating system (MAC or Windows)
* Extract the file and run the program

## For MAC Users - Not Supported?
READ: The client is not supposed to be stuck/taking long at the loading bar, that means that you have not done steps #4-6 *properly*!
You ONLY have to do steps #4-6 **ONCE**!
If you are unsure, message me on twitter for help! @133spider

1. Go to "Releases" (or goto this link https://github.com/133spider/AQLite/releases)
2. Download **AQLite - SWF.zip**
3. Extract the file anywhere (or the desktop)

4. Go to this link in your browser: https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html

5. At the link, there should be a panel called "Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager". In the panel, near the bottom right: click "Edit Locations", then "Add Locations"

6. Inside the textbox for "Trusted location:" enter the FULL directory/path to where the .swf file has been extracted from step #3! After, press the confirm button.
Example: */Users/Me/Desktop/aqlite.swf*
Please note that this HAS to be the correct directory/path otherwise the client will be stuck at the loading screen/bar!

7. Download Adobe Flash Player's Official Mac Projector at this link: https://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/32/flashplayer_32_sa.dmg
8. Open the projector (.dmg file) and no window should open or pop-up. This is normal. The top left corner of your computer should now say "Flash Player"
9. Now, on the top left corner of your computer, choose the options: *File > Open File > Browse*
