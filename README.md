## Information

AQLite is a client made for AQWorlds that provides all sorts of Quality of Life tools that have been longed for. With the approach of the new versions of AQWorlds (AQW2 and AQW:Mobile), I am releasing AQLite to help players wait for the forever-waited changes to the game. AQLite is open-sourced to assure that there is no account-stealing, or any funny business contained in the client!

## Installation

* Click the text that says "CLICK ME FOR LAUNCHER DOWNLOAD OPTIONS"
* Choose and Download the .zip file according to your operating system
* Extract the file and run the program
* If you get ElectronJS, make sure to Force Update your client! (The latest version is Version 9.1!)

**Client stuck at 0?**

Make sure that the directory that AQLite is in does not contain any accents!

Example of a directory containing accent marks: C:\Users\Andr**Ã©**\Desktop\AQLite

To fix this issue, put AQLite in your C:\ Drive, or any other directories that do not contain accent marks!

**Accents not an issue?**

1. Go here: https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html
2. Edit Location > Add Location
3. Put the location of the AQLite folder

**APPLE/MAC USERS**: "Browse for files" & "Browse for folder" do NOT work on MAC Computers. You have to manually enter the AQLite folder directory.
4. Confirm & Run AQLite

## Warning
AQLite is in Beta; be cautious of potential bugs and glitches!

## Donation
I love to create programs for free for those that need it.    
If you'd like to donate some money to help out a College kid like me, that would be much appreciated!
