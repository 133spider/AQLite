## Information

AQLite is a client made for AQWorlds that provides all sorts of Quality of Life tools that have been longed for. With the approach of the new versions of AQWorlds (AQW2 and AQW:Mobile), I am releasing AQLite to help players wait for the forever-waited changes to the game. AQLite is open-sourced to assure that there is no account-stealing, or any funny business contained in the client!

## Donate!

I love to create programs for free for those that need it.    
If you'd like to donate some money to help out a College kid like me, that would be much appreciated!

Make sure that the directory that AQLite is in does not contain any accents!

Example of a directory containing accent marks: C:\Users\Andr**Ã©**\Desktop\AQLite

To fix this issue, put AQLite in your C:\ Drive, or any other directories that do not contain accent marks!
