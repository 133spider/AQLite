## Information

AQLite is a client made for AQWorlds that provides all sorts of Quality of Life tools that have been longed for. With the approach of the new versions of AQWorlds (AQW2 and AQW:Mobile), I am releasing AQLite to help players wait for the forever-waited changes to the game. AQLite is open-sourced to assure that there is no account-stealing, or any funny business contained in the client!

## Installation
* Goto this link https://github.com/133spider/AQLite/releases/tag/6.0.1
* Choose and Download the .zip file according to your operating system
* Extract the file and run the program
* Make sure to Force Update your client!

## Stuck at 0%
* Client stuck at 0?
Make sure that the directory that AQLite is in does not contain any accents!

Example of a directory containing accent marks: C:\Users\Andr√©\Desktop\AQLite

To fix this issue, put AQLite in your C:\ Drive, or any other directories that do not contain accent marks!

## Warning

AQLite is in Beta; be cautious of potential bugs and glitches!
