## Information

AQLite is a client made for AQWorlds that provides all sorts of Quality of Life tools that have been longed for. With the approach of the new versions of AQWorlds (AQW2 and AQW:Mobile), I am releasing AQLite to help players wait for the forever-waited changes to the game. AQLite is open-sourced to assure that there is no account-stealing, or any funny business contained in the client!

## Donate!

I love to create programs for free for those that need it.    
If you'd like to donate some money to help out a College kid like me, that would be much appreciated!

## Stuck at 0%
**Client stuck at 0?**

Make sure that the directory that AQLite is in does not contain any accents!

Example of a directory containing accent marks: C:\Users\Andr**Ã©**\Desktop\AQLite

To fix this issue, put AQLite in your C:\ Drive, or any other directories that do not contain accent marks!

**Still stuck at 0%?**

1. Delete the folder at: C:\Users\You\AppData\Roaming\AQLite
2. Run AQLite

**Accents not an issue?**

**UPDATE your Adobe Flash Player!**

1. Go here: https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html
2. Edit Location > Add Location
3. Put the location of AQLite

**APPLE/MAC USERS**: "Browse for files" & "Browse for folder" do NOT work on MAC Computers. You have to manually enter the AQLite folder directory.
