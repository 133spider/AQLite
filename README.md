## Information

AQLite is a client made for AQWorlds that provides all sorts of Quality of Life tools that have been longed for. With the approach of the new versions of AQWorlds (AQW2 and AQW:Mobile), I am releasing AQLite to help players wait for the forever-waited changes to the game. AQLite is open-sourced to assure that there is no account-stealing, or any funny business contained in the client!
